IOS app for pizza delivery drivers

## **Description**

Dï»¿uring the COVID-19 pandemic I worked a job as a pizza delivery driver. I wanted to created a companion application for my shifts which compiled helpful metrics and provided custom mapping features which I desired.

## **Role**

Sï»¿ole Developer

## **Skills Utilized**

## **Contribution**

Rï»¿ight before coming to the University of Pittsburgh I got a macbook for school. I decided to learn how to program through swift to create an app which would help me with my job. This sparked my love for computer science and filling needs in my own and other's lives through software.

Iï»¿ created an iOS native application which tracked important shift metrics and provided text only directions with multiple stops.

## **Outcome**

Pï»¿izza Buddy allowed me to effectively group customer orders to deliver pizza orders faster and increase my tips ðŸ˜™

## **Key Takeaways**

Lï»¿et the problem you wish to solve drive which technologies you learn/use in a project. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
